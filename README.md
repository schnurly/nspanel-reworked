NsPanel Lovelace UI is a Firmware for the nextion screen inside of NSPanel in the Design of [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)'s Lovelace UI Design.

**EU Model and US Model supported (in portrait and landscape orientation)**

Content of the screen is controlled by a AppDaemon Python Script installed on your HomeAssistant Instance.

Or an TypeScript on your ioBroker Instance in case you are an ioBroker User.

NsPanel needs to be flashed with Tasmota (or upcoming with ESPHome)
